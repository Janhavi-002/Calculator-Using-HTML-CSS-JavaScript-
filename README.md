# Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-

I have built a simple, yet functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of basic web development concepts and allowed me to explore interactive front-end elements.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Markup structure for the calculator layout.
CSS: Used for styling and creating the calculator's look and feel, including modern design features like shadows and rounded buttons.
JavaScript: Implemented the functionality for the calculator, including handling user inputs, performing calculations, and displaying the results.
